This is a basic note and you have multiple ways linking to [[:john]]

- Some normal [link by sid](:john)
- Using the note [uid](21097c71-52a7-4048-8d2b-09d82a279527)

But you do not have to create a link. Just like you can link to :john by sid, you can also just type the uid 21097c71-52a7-4048-8d2b-09d82a279527. It is just a matter of how it will be rendered later to html.
